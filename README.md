# Node-Express-Handlebars
This website utilizes MySQL and Express server with express-handlebars in order to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) from a database while dynamically altering the website. It features a menu with a "DEVOURED!" section. The user can choose to add a new burger to the menu which will then add that burger to the databse. Then, the user may "devour" the burger (updating the "devoured" boolean) or delete the burger. The website will create menu list items dynamically on the page with the user's actions.
